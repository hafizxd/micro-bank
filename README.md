# Micro Bank
With the purpose of revoking my Backend Development and Deployment with Containerization expertises, this includes:
- Understanding DB isolation levels.
- Using Docker and deploy it to a production Kubernetes cluster on AWS. Also using GitHub Action to automatically build and deploy the image to the EKS cluster.
- Build gRPC APIs
- Build RESTful HTTP APIs using Gin. This includes loading app configs, mocking DB unit tests, handling errors, authenticating users, authorizing with JWT and PASETO, and managing refresh token
- Embedding Swagger as part of the backend service
- Writing logger HTTP middlewares and gRPC interceptors
- Build asynchronous processing with background workers and Redis as its message queue
- Send emails to users via Gmail SMTP server
- Writing unit tests for gRPC services that might involve mocking multiple dependencies at once
